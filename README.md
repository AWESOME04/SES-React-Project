SES React Project is a web application developed using React for a Software Engineering course. It provides functionality for user registration, login, and a dashboard to display user information.

## Features

- **Student Registration**: 
    New students can register by providing their name, email, password, and confirming the password.     
    Validation is performed to ensure that all required fields are filled and that the password and confirm password match.
    Upon successful registration, the student is redirected to the login page.

## Technologies Used

The Student Registration App is built using the following technologies and libraries:

- React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- React Router: A routing library for managing navigation in React applications.
- HTML5: Markup language for creating the structure of web pages.
- CSS3: Style sheet language for styling web pages.
- JavaScript: Programming language for adding interactivity to web pages.

The app follows a component-based architecture where each feature (StudentRegistration, Login, StudentInfoEntry, and Dashboard) is implemented as a separate React component. React Router is used for managing the routing between these components.
